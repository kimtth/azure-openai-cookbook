Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.", "task_id": "task019_mctaco_temporal_reasoning_category"}, "seed": 42}, "d_test": {"_type": "DataTable", "records": [{"input": "Sentence: He also had very short legs, but really big paws. \nQuestion: What happened before he had big paws? \nCategory: Event Ordering.", "output": "Yes."}, {"input": "Sentence: Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce , a single father who is away from the museum that night . \nQuestion: How often is Michael at the museum? \nCategory: Frequency.", "output": "Yes."}, {"input": "Sentence: Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. \nQuestion: How often does Max see his doggy friend? \nCategory: Frequency.", "output": "Yes."}, {"input": "Sentence: She began to tell the story of Majestic, the wild horse who could not be calmed. \nQuestion: Is the horse calm today? \nCategory: Transient v.

Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.     >    > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called \"Crimes Against Society.\" Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation.

We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge.

Apartment Owner: Okay. Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers.
