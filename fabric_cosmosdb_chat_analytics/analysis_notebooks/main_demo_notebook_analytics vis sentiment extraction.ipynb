We will query chat history, leverage Fabric's built-in Azure OpenAI capabilities, identify product mentions, and determine the sentiments expressed around each product feature. This analysis will help us understand customer perceptions and preferences, enabling us to make informed decisions and enhance our product development strategies.\n","\n","Additionally, we will aggregate the counts for each feature and sentiment to provide a comprehensive overview of the data.

It typically involved several steps and required expertise in natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and feature extraction.\n","\n","1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like product names, brands, and types required training NER models on annotated datasets. This process involved manually labeling a large amount of data, training the model, and continuously fine-tuning it to improve accuracy.\n","\n","2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment around each product mentioned in the conversation required separate sentiment analysis models. These models also needed to be trained on labeled data and fine-tuned to handle the nuances of human language.\n","\n","3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting features that are liked or disliked about each product involved additional NLP techniques. This often required custom rule-based systems or machine learning models to identify and categorize features mentioned in the text.\n","\n","4. **Integration and Transformation**: Combining the outputs of these different models into a structured format like JSON required additional code to integrate the results and transform them into the desired format.\n","\n","With LLMs, the workflow is significantly simplified:\n","\n","- **Unified Model**: LLMs can perform multiple NLP tasks within a single model. This means that the same model can handle NER, sentiment analysis, and feature extraction without the need for separate models for each task.\n","- **Prompt Engineering**: Instead of training and fine-tuning multiple models, you can use prompt engineering to guide the LLM to generate the desired output. This involves crafting a prompt that instructs the model on what information to extract and how to format it.\n","- **Reduced Manual Effort**: LLMs can understand and generate human-like text, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling and fine-tuning. This makes it easier to adapt the model to new tasks and domains.\n","- **Scalability**: LLMs can process large volumes of data quickly and accurately, making it easier to scale the extraction process to handle more conversations and extract more detailed information.\n","\n","In summary, LLMs simplify the workflow by providing a unified model that can handle multiple NLP tasks, reducing the need for manual effort and making it easier to scale the extraction process.
